Here is a sample tool to try out this docker/compose configuration.

### Build
To build, run
```
make
```
It will generate a binary file name `sample`.


### `sample`
`sample` spits out the number of arguments given to it, followed by the arguments themselves. For example,
```
$ sample hello world
2
hello world
```
